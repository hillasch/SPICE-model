# we wnat to get some evaluation metrics fot our model ' in the origin 
# paper they said that the new image dont save the oroginal context fporm the sorce iamge '
# so we want to the the similarity between the source image and the new image
# we can use the dino model to get the features of the images and then calculate the
# cosine similarity between the features of the source image and the new image
